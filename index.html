        <h1>Understanding "ESA Star Mapper"</h1>

            ESA Star Mapper is visualisation is an exploration of some central aspects of astrometric star catalogues, 
            using data from ESA’s 1989 Hipparcos mission. This catalogue listed 117 955 stars, reporting their positions 
            with unprecedented accuracy, alongside estimates of their distance from us and motions through the Galaxy. It 
            was a huge advance on the best catalogues compiled from ground-based observations, which contained information 
            for just over 8000 stars.<br><br>This interactive experience allows users to delve into this famous dataset, 
            exploring the three-dimensional distribution of almost 60 000 stars from the Hipparcos Catalogue. Stars are visualised 
            as a function of their brightness; it is also possible to show their colours, as well as names and parent constellations 
            for the brightest stars. Users can get a sense of where in the sky stars were located in the past – or will be in the future
            – based on their motions measured by Hipparcos.
