        </div>
        <div class="intro" > 
            Like all gyms, Blink Fitness has fake advertising, endless hidden costs and is extremely
             hard to cancel. Gyms always make it embarrassing to cancel their memberships, but Blink
              makes sure to punish and shame you for doing it. 
        </div> 
        <div class="hiddencosts">
            <h2>HIDDEN COSTS</h2>
            <p>Hidden costs are a dark pattern where the cost shown is remarkably less, but as soon as
                 the customer reaches the final step to complete the purchase, the cost increases by 
                 adding taxes and hidden fees.<br><br> Blink’s hidden costs include a $60 annual maintenance 
                 fee on the first day of the second month. Even if you don’t choose to keep the membership
                  for a whole year, you are still charged this maintenance fee upon starting the membership.</p>

        <div class="forcedcontinuity">
            <h2>FORCED CONTINUITY</h2>
            <p>Forced continuity is a dark pattern used by digital services with subscriptions models where
                 users are asked to provide payment information while signing up for the trial period, and
                later they are automatically charged without any notification. <br><br> Blink’s cancellation 
                is practically impossible to get without the $60 cancellation fee. And even then, you are
                required to send an email to blink or go in person to demonstrate the reason why you want
                to cancel (you can also upload a document to their online platform, but nobody will respond).
                After a couple of weeks, you will get an email saying that your cancellation form has been
                 reviewed and that you will be charged the cancellation fee. <br> <br>
                 There are 3 exceptions in which you can cancel without the cancellation fee: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>If you have a doctor's note proving that you are unable to do exercise for more than 6 months. </li>
                <li>If you have proof of moving into a new house more than 25 miles from any blink location.  </li>
                <li>If you die. Only valid by presenting a death certificate.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="roachmodel">
            <h2>ROACH MODEL</h2>
            <p>Roach model is a dark pattern that makes it easy for users to get into a situation but hard
                 to get out of. Memberships and subscriptions usually have a Roach model.<br><br>
                Blink advertises a “Flash Sale” with a $0 joining fee. Although it may seem like it, 
                this does not mean it will cost you $0 to join the gym. It will still cost you the $39 
                of the usual monthly membership cost, simply without the joining fee.</p>
